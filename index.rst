Intro
========


Today we will be exploring Hybrid Cloud with a focus on |_VCF| (VCF) and **HCX**. We will start by looking at what VCF is and deconstruct it's make-up into easy digestable bytes. The bootcamp is intended to be interactive, we hope you'll have lot's of questions throughout the day and would love to understand the business and technical problems you have and how VMware solutions can help to solve them. 


Agenda
=======

As part of every module, there could be a challenge to complete. These are optional however we encourage everyone to have to a go.

Before each module, the instructor will discuss and demonstrate the topic. Whilst we like enthusiasm we recommend everyone pauses at the completion of each module until the instructor starts that particular topic.
